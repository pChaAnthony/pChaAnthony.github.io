    work! great!

jekyllrb:
Ruby: it needs Ruby version 2.5.0 or higher
  I am using rbenv, check available version
    rbenv install --list
      2.6.8
      2.7.4
      3.0.2
    as v3 might be too different, use 2.7.4
    ruby -v
      ruby 2.3.3p222 (2016-11-21 revision 56859) [x86_64-darwin15]
    $ rbenv local 2.7.4
    rbenv: version `2.7.4' not installed
    OPS, not install yet, let's go with 2.6.5 which I know exists.
    rbenv local 2.6.5
    ruby -v
    ruby 2.6.5p114 (2019-10-01 revision 67812) [x86_64-darwin20]
    done

Install jekyll:
  gem install jekyll bundler
  ops...
    Permission denied @ dir_s_mkdir - /Users/Anthony/....
    $ whoami
    Anthony
    sudo chown -R Anthony $HOME/.rbenv
    gem install jekyll bundler
      take long time...
?? create jekyll project ??
  jekyll new web
  start
    cd web
    bundle exec jekyll serve
    http://127.0.0.1:4000/

from root:
  jekyll serve = jekyll build + runs it on a local web server at http://localhost:4000

Learning: on jekyll 4.2.2, later use github_page gem, it is now jekyll 3.9.0
  Liquid:
    {{ page.title }}

    {% if page.show_sidebar %}
    <div class="sidebar">
      sidebar content
    </div>
    {% endif %}

    {{ "hi" | capitalize }}

    front matter
      put below at top
      ---
      # front matter tells Jekyll to process Liquid
      ---
      have to have two --- at beginning of file to notice jekyll process

  layout:
    default layout at _layouts/default.html

  md:
    just write the md with front matter and using layout, page can be created easily, bravo.

  navigation
    cane be done via include:
      _includes/navigation.html
      add navigation here for changing page.

  data:
    data is ok loading from YAML, JSON, and CSV
    _data/navigation.yml = can be read by = site.data.navigation

  css:
    css can be write at:
      directly at assets/css/styles/scss
      or have a @import "main"; here, and then, it will read
      _sass/main.scss

  blog post:
    must be in this format: the publish date + a title + extension
    _posts/2018-08-20-bananas.md
    blogs available as site.posts

  Collections:
    setting collection name in _config.yml is must, "authors" for example,
    collection folder:
      collections' document are stored in: _*collection_name* folder, (so, author = _authors)
       and by default it is not output, need to set:
       output: true at _config.yml
    collection available as sites.authors

  Front matter defaults
    we can save each page's layout in _config.yml by using
    defaults: # default is set by scope - values pair
      - scope:
          path: "" # an empty string here means all files in the project, or "folder name"
          type: "authors" # pages, posts, drafts or collections, optional
        values:
          layout: "author"
        ...
      but, I don't see the value of using it...

>>> i18n?
  how rails use Jekyll build their marketing site.
    https://cloudcannon.com/blog/showcase-ruby-on-rails/

>>> themes
  doc - https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/
  You can have multiple themes listed in your site’s Gemfile, but only one theme can be selected in your site’s _config.yml.
  GitHub Pages supports the following themes:
    Architect
    Cayman
    Dinky
    Hacker
    Leap day
    Merlot
    Midnight
    Minima
    Minimal
    Modernist
    Slate
    Tactile
    Time machine
  or remote_theme: at github, doc: https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/adding-a-theme-to-your-github-pages-site-using-jekyll#adding-a-jekyll-theme-in-your-sites-_configyml-file

test:
  bundle exec jekyll serve
    http://127.0.0.1:4000

environemt:
  bundle
    add:
      bundle add jekyll
      or
      add in Gemfile:
        bundle install
    update:
      bundle update
    test/exec:
      bundle exec jekyll serve

deployment
  cd ~/huzzii_web
    or cd /Users/Anthony/huzzii_web
  git status
  git add --all
  git commit -m "xxxx"
  git push

  // got error on error: failed to push some refs to 'github.com:pChaAnthony/pChaAnthony.github.io.git'
    hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
    hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing...
    what I did is:
    ref: https://gitbook.tw/chapters/github/fail-to-push
  git pull --rebase

  GitHub's action will auto build/deploy:
    https://pchaanthony.github.io/

Try/learning:
  GitHub 有個 actions 很厲害，commit/push 後，它會自動將 Jekyll 的 _site 檔案 deploy 到成網案，所以根本就不需要再做自動 deploy 的動作。
  add gemfile -
    jekyll version and plugins: deploy test ok.

  github-pages gem?
    in the NEWly created by Jekyll gemfiles there is a remark:
    # If you want to use GitHub Pages, remove the "gem "jekyll"" above and
    # uncomment the line below. To upgrade, run `bundle update github-pages`.
    # gem "github-pages", group: :jekyll_plugins
    but when I follow it, and run gem install or gem update, it pop up:
      jekyll-feed (>= 0.16.0)
      jekyll-seo-tag (>= 2.8.0)...
    delete gemfile.lock, re-run bundle update.
    now, ok, but:
    jekyll 3.9.0
    ok, this is the correct way, as Githut only accept certain version.
    ref: https://pages.github.com/versions/
    test: upload to GitHub, test ok

Production ONLY - Pending
  we don't have anything need to set to production only, so:
  JEKYLL_ENV not in used yet:
    https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/10-deployment/
    code:
      {% if jekyll.environment == "production" %}
        <script src="my-analytics-script.js"></script>
      {% endif %}
    deploy:
      JEKYLL_ENV=production bundle exec jekyll build

  auto deploy to github pages:
    https://jekyllrb.com/docs/continuous-integration/github-actions/
    look like no needs.

Theme:

  minima:
    bundle add minima
    test: not working...
    _config.yml -
      add:
        theme: minima
        index.html layout (change in _config.yml) switch from default to home, everything changed... why?
    so, question is: How to use Jekyll's theme?
      found it, basically, it load the default 1st, and then, override by local.

  minimal: we use this, after using github_page gem, it already bundle installed.

    _config.yml:
      remote_theme: pages-themes/minimal@v0.2.0

    download minimal theme to local:
      _layouts/default.html: change it.
      assets/css/style.css:
        @import "{{ site.theme }}"; # as we use
        add navigation css.
          ref: https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_navbar.asp

    add:
      privacy.md
      service.md

    app-ads.txt:
      add file+content in root,
      test:
        http://127.0.0.1:4000/app-ads.txt, it shown, let's see wet
        https://pchaanthony.github.io/app-ads.txt - ok, good.

    markdown ref: https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics

  add video:
    just add the embedded youtube code in, markdown is ok with raw HTML.


custom domain link:
  setting:
    https://github.com/pChaAnthony/pChaAnthony.github.io/settings/pages
  try www.huzzii.com... but always got error..
  switch/add huzzii.com, follow this blog:
    https://dev.to/trentyang/how-to-setup-google-domain-for-github-pages-1p58
  still got error:
    Both huzzii.com and its alternate name are improperly configured
    Domain does not resolve to the GitHub Pages server. For more information,
    see Learn more (NotServedByPagesError).
    We recommend you add an A record pointed to our IP addresses,
    or an ALIAS record pointing to pchaanthony.github.io.
  but, the HTTPs is on, and when I try www.huzzii.com, it jump to huzzii.com with SSL.
  actually, just 2 hours after, reload page, all the error gone.
  now, github page linked with huzzii.com and www.huzzii.com will auto routed

  try 1: but fail, not workable in github page.
    use: https://github.com/kurtsson/jekyll-multiple-languages-plugin gem, follow it instructions:

    Install gem: follow it 3.1. Using the gem:
      gemfile:
        add: gem 'jekyll-multiple-languages-plugin', group: :jekyll_plugins

          languages: ["en", "zh", "zh-tw"]
          exclude_from_localizations: ["js", "img", "css", "favicon.ico"]

      ?? In code, these specific files should be referenced via baseurl_root. E.g.

theme jekyll-theme-minimal-0.2.0
  /Users/Anthony/.rbenv/versions/2.6.5/lib/ruby/gems/2.6.0/gems/jekyll-theme-minimal-0.2.0
  copy _includes 2 head-custom* in

favicon
  create & add a favicon in root,
  copy the theme bundler's head-custom.html
  un-remark:
    <link rel="shortcut icon" type="image/x-icon" href="{{ '/favicon.ico' | relative_url }}">
  test:
    not working in beginning, but all the suddently, it show... due to browser cache? no idea.

google analytics
  gosh, it is difficult to find, and actually, have to create a new one.
  create a new property - Huzzii.com
    follow: https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/10269537
    now, there are 2 properties created.
  now, I got tracking info at: admin/proprtty/Tracking info:

  <!-- Global site tag (gtag.js) - Google Analytics -->
  <script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=UA-215802950-1"></script>
  <script>
    window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
    function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
    gtag('js', new Date());

    gtag('config', 'UA-215802950-1');
  </script>

  but checking with head-custom-google-analytics.html, it is:
    <script>
      (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){
      (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),
              m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)
          })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');
      ga('create', '{{ site.google_analytics }}', 'auto');
      ga('send', 'pageview');
    </script>

  Decided: use the jekyll-theme-minimal way, I can change it back anytime.
    change:
      _config.yml:
        google_analytics: UA-215802950-1

    change the head-custom.html
      {% if jekyll.environment == 'production' %}
        {% include head-custom-google-analytics.html %}
      {% endif %}

  check GA: yes, it works.

app-ads.txt
  show when https://huzzii.com/app-ads.txt
  add to google play store and confirmed store show the correct url. (2022-3-11 0am)
